                                    The digital divide is a commonly used term to describe the gap which exists between demographics who have access to modern technology, and those who do not (or who have restricted access). In the context of our project, this technology includes access to the internet and internet-enabled devices at home (personal digital access) as well as level of digital literacy in school-age children (K-12). The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in the mass closure of schools across Canada and the world, sending many school children home to complete their education online. This phenomenon has the potential to widen the gap created by the digital divide.

                                        Micheal explores digital divide in terms of people having access to the internet 
                                        and the online activity generated by people of different classes, communities and social 
                                        groups. Author also talks about the changing definition of digital divide. In earlier years 
                                        digital divide was whether a person or family had a connection to the internet or not 
                                        and the quality of the connection. Nowadays digital divide refers more to the online 
                                        activity generated by the different people or the ability to generate a certain amount of 
                                        digital activity. The author has divided the digital activity in two groups. One group is 
                                        surfing the web for information or entertainment while the other group who leverages Social 
                                        Networking Services (SNS). The author for most part has emphasized on the group leveraging 
                                        SNS in his research. The author studies the digital divide of leveraging connectivity on SNS 
                                        based on gender. “According to a 2013 Pew Internet and American Life report on social networking, 
                                        women are no longer more likely to use SNSs than men in the United States (Duggan, 2013). 
                                        The gap in SNS use by gender is closing from a difference of 15% (68% of women and 53% of men) in 
                                        2010 to just 4% (74% of women and 70% of men) in 2013, which is a result that is no longer 
                                        statistically significant.”[1] It also explores people having an internet connection and being able 
                                        to generate digital activity based on income levels and the level of education a person has.

                                        Beaunoyer examines specifically the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on existing digital 
                                        inequalities. She shows that a lack of digital access cuts people off from access to services, 
                                        especially during lockdown. Beaunoyer discusses how education being even more dependent on 
                                        digital access disproportionately affects the children of lower-income households. She states: 
                                        “Limited access to digital technologies generally implies limited access to services, resources, 
                                        and information – and their potential benefits – and an altered pattern of access to the other 
                                        determinants of health (Golder, Newman, Biedrzycki, & Baum, 2010)”. Some gaps in this research exist. 
                                        It assumes that lower-income households will have slower access to the internet and fewer internet 
                                        enabled devices. It is also not specific to Canada and doesn’t consider how students being in 
                                        class in places like Ontario changes the availability of digital access. Lastly, it makes some 
                                        predictions about long term effects of COVID-19, which we won’t be able to validate until many 
                                        years from now.

                                        In his study, Frenette provides an analysis of how the academic performance/learning quality of K-12 
                                        school children is impacted by the nation-wide closure of schools in Canada due to the pandemic. 
                                        He discusses the necessity of student access to online resources and internet-connected devices, and how 
                                        lower-income families might struggle with accessing these resources. This research estimates the 
                                        percentage of Canadian households with children under the age of 18 who have steady access to these 
                                        learning tools, as compared to their household income. This article finds that while most Canadian 
                                        households with children under 18 have internet access at home, there are fewer internet-enabled devices 
                                        per household member in lower-income households. This could pose a disadvantage to children of lower-income 
                                        families who are forced to learn in a fully remote setting. Some gaps in this research exist; the article 
                                        doesn’t differentiate between online preparedness in cities as compared to suburbs. While this article was 
                                        published in April, a lot has changed since then; the pandemic situation is unraveling every day and we 
                                        have since seen some students head back to school while others stay at home to learn virtually. This 
                                        phenomenon might change some of the impacts of online preparedness.

                                        In this source, Alison explores the amount of time students are spending in online 
                                        learning during the COVID-19 pandemic correlated with household income. 
                                        The online study includes 4000 parent participants of children aged 4–15 between Wednesday 29 April and Tuesday 12 May 2020. 
                                        The obvious limitation to this data is that it will skew towards families who have a higher level of digital literacy and access to the internet. 
                                        As a result it may leave out families at the bottom level of income and digital access. 
                                        Further, this study took place in April 2020, and much about the learning environment has changed since then, which could also affect the data. 
                                        The study suggested a positive correlation between the income of a household and the child(ren) of that household’s time spent online learning: 
                                        “Children in the highest-income fifth of families spend 5.8 hours a day on educational activities, over 75 minutes more than their peers in the 
                                        poorest fifth of households (4.5 hours).” It also suggested a positive correlation between household income and engagement of parent in student 
                                        learning.

                                        success in a remote environment, including the increase in mental health issues for vulnerable students due to extra family and financial 
                                        stressors during this already stressful time. In examining the lowest quintile of household income, the article finds that vulnerable 
                                        students are more likely to be disengaged, which can lead to lower academic and social outcomes. Students are more inclined to 
                                        experience issues related to digital access, including a steady high-speed internet connection and the required devices, which 
                                        severely impacts the ability to succeed at online learning from home. Children from lower-income households are more likely to be 
                                        exposed to inappropriate material and cyberbullying online. By using this source we are making the assumption that the experience of 
                                        children from lower-income households in Australia is similar to that of children in Canada, and that the impact of COVID-19 school 
                                        closures on both populations are comparable. Although this article focuses on a different population I still believe it is useful to our 
                                        project as it makes many important connections between a child’s socioeconomic status and their educational impact due to COVID-19. 
                                        This paper made us wonder about the impact of socioeconomic status on a Canadian child’s digital literacy; how does a lack of digital 
                                        literacy impact the child’s ability to learn effectively in an online setting?

                                        Greenlee explores parental support for learning at home for children 14 years and older during the COVID-19 pandemic in a Canadian context. 
                                        It was an online survey that took place from June 9 to 22, 2020, and involved over 32,000 parents or guardians. It explores multiple 
                                        demographics and how they correlate specifically to internet access and online activity. There are major limitations to this study. A 
                                        large proportion of the participants in the study were women who possessed a bachelor's degree or higher. Since the survey was online, 
                                        it skews the participants towards those who have digital access, omitting the most vulnerable groups. As a result, the findings reflect 
                                        only the responses of those who completed the questionnaire and “cannot be generalized to the entire Canadian population.”[1] The findings 
                                        indicate that the level of education of the parents had a positive correlation with the amount of structured academic activities their 
                                        child participated in at home. In addition, it also found that the parents' level of education had a positive correlation with their level 
                                        of concern in their child’s academic success.
